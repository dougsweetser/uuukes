## Goals

My main goal is to have fun again with the people who play the ukulele. My
second goal is to sound better while I play. These tutorials are great, so long
as one actually spends time with them.

The idea is to spend a half hour on the tutorials and another half hour playing
anyone's choice song from The Big Yellow Book. Previous weeks songs are always
allowed.

## Doug's Checklist of Stuff to Bring

I find a [check list](pdfs/stuff_checklist.pdf) allows me to think less and do more, a good combination.
You can ignore the tech section probably. I print this out, get the stuff while
not thinking much at all.
