## Goals

My main goal is to have fun again with the people who play the ukulele. My
second goal is to sound better while I play. These tutorials are great, so long
as one actually spends time with them.

The idea is to spend a half hour on the tutorials and another half hour playing
anyone's choice song from The Big Yellow Book. Previous weeks songs are always
allowed.
